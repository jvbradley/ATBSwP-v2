    In this chapter, we used the dictionary value {'1h': 'bking', '6c':
    'wqueen', '2g': 'bbishop', '5h': 'bqueen', '3e': 'wking'} to represent a
    chess board. Write a function named isValidChessBoard() that takes a
    dictionary argument and returns True or False depending on if the board is
    valid.

    A valid board will have exactly one black king and exactly one white king.
    Each player can only have at most 16 pieces, at most 8 pawns, and all
    pieces must be on a valid space from '1a' to '8h'; that is, a piece canâ€™t
    be on space '9z'. The piece names begin with either a 'w' or 'b' to
    represent white or black, followed by 'pawn', 'knight', 'bishop', 'rook',
    'queen', or 'king'.

    This function should detect when a bug has resulted in an improper chess
    board.
